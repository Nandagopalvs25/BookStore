# BookStore web application
Watch the demo of the project at [https://youtu.be/XWo0PKRS6GU]

## Solution
I chose the project option 1 of the task 2 ie an Online Bookstore. 
I began the project by designing the database structure, i.e., the models, in Django based on the project requirements. I have used Postgres for the database. After designing the models, I planned out the features I needed to implement.Â 

-User Authentication [login, register]

-View and Search Books

-Cart Management

-Order creation

-Create,Edit,Delete Book Listings

I was able to implement the business logic (views) very quickly with the help of Django's generic views. I implemented JWT-based authentication using the [SimpleJWT package](https://pypi.org/project/djangorestframework-simplejwt/)

I implemented rest API endpoints for the corresponding features and documented them using Swagger docs.

Designing the backend was relatively easy with my prior experience with the framework.
However, designing the frontend part was a bit challenging since I did not have much experience in frontend development. After learning the basics of React, I started working on the frontend. To save time and reduce the hassle of writing CSS, I decided to use the [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) framework, which helped me to create a basic, user-friendly, and responsive UI.

I have also used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for the frontend development. 

## Project setup
Pre requisites:
 - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
 - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
 - [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en)

1. Create a folder and clone the repo 
```
 git clone https://github.com/Nandagopalvs25/BookStore
```
3. Install Virtual env to create a python virtual environment
```
   cd Bookstore
   pip install virtualenv
   python<version> -m venv <virtual-environment-name>
   env/Scripts/activate.bat //Activate virtual env In CMD
   env/Scripts/Activate.ps1 //Activate virtual env In Powershel
```
3. Install dependencies for the api
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Create a new PostgreSQL database using createdb or the pgAdmin tool
```
createdb --username=postgres <db_name>
```
5. Create a .env file in the backend dir and set the enviornment variables for the database
 ```
  DB_NAME=
  DB_USER=
  DB_PWD=
  DB_HOST=
  DB_PORT=
```
6. Apply migrations
```
python manage.py migrate
```
7. Run the server using
```
python manage.py runserver
